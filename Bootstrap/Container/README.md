# Containers
Containers are a fundamental building block of Bootstrap that contain, pad, and align your content within a given device or viewport.

## Bootstrap comes with three different containers:

- .container, which sets a max-width at each responsive breakpoint
- .container-{breakpoint}, which is width: 100% until the specified breakpoint
- .container-fluid, which is width: 100% at all breakpoints
