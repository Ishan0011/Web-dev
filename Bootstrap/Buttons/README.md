# Buttons
Use Bootstrap’s custom button styles for actions in forms, dialogs, and more with support for multiple sizes, states, and more.
   
# Base class 
Bootstrap has a base .btn class that sets up basic styles such as padding and content alignment. By default, .btn controls have a transparent border and background color, and lack any explicit focus and hover styles.
