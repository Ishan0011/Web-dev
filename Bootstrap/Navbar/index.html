            <h1>Programming language</h1>
            Programming languages have some similarity to natural languages in that they can allow communication of ideas between 
            people. That is, programs are generally human-readable and can express complex ideas. However, the kinds of ideas that
            programming languages can express are ultimately limited to the domain of computation.[4]
            The term computer language is sometimes used interchangeably with programming language[5] but some contend they are different 
            concepts. Some contend that programming languages are a subset of computer languages.[6] Some use computer language to classify 
            a language used in computing that is not considered a programming language.[citation needed] Some regard a programming language 
            as a theoretical construct for programming an abstract machine, and a computer language as the subset thereof that runs on a 
            physical computer, which has finite hardware resources.[7]

            John C. Reynolds emphasizes that a formal specification language is as much a programming language as is a language intended 
            for execution. He argues that textual and even graphical input formats that affect the behavior of a computer are programming 
            languages, despite the fact they are commonly not Turing-complete, and remarks that ignorance of programming language concepts 
            is the reason for many flaws in input formats.[8]
