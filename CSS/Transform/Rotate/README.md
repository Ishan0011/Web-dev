# Rotate in CSS

The `rotate()` function is used with the `transform` property to rotate an element around a fixed point.

Rotation is measured in degrees and can rotate elements clockwise(+) or counterclockwise(-).

Rotate is commonly used to create visual effects, animations, and interactive UI elements.

- transform: rotate(45deg);
