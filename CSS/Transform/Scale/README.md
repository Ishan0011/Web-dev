# Scale in CSS

The `scale()` function is used with the `transform` property to change the size of an element.

It can increase or decrease the size of an element along the horizontal and vertical axes(X/Y).

Scaling does not affect the layout of other elements and is commonly used for hover and animation effects.

- transform: scale(0.5); (Along both X&Y Direction)
- transform: scale(0.5 2 ); | (X,Y)
