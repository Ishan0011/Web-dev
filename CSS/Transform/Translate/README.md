# Translate in CSS

The `translate()` function is used with the `transform` property to move an element from its original position.

It shifts elements along the horizontal (X) and vertical (Y) axes without affecting the layout of other elements.

- Along both direction X Y :- ` transform: translate(30px,30px);`  
- Along X :- `transform: translateX(30px);`
- Along Y :- `transform: translateY(30px);`
