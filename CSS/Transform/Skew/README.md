# Skew in CSS

The `skew()` function is used with the `transform` property to tilt an element along the X and Y axes.

It distorts the shape of an element by slanting it horizontally or vertically.

- `transform: skew(30deg);`
- `transform: skew(90deg);` - The element becomes infinitely stretched and disappear.
