#   Font-Size Units in CSS

CSS provides different units to define font sizes. These units are mainly divided into **Absolute** and **Relative** units.

--

## Absolute Units
Absolute units have a fixed size and do not scale based on screen size or parent elements.

Common absolute units include:
- **px** – Pixels (most commonly used absolute unit)
- **pt** – Points (used mainly for print)
- **pc** – Picas
- **cm** – Centimeters
- **mm** – Millimeters
- **in** – Inches

Absolute units are not recommended for responsive design.

--

## Relative Units
Relative units adjust according to screen size, parent elements, or root settings.

Common relative units include:
- **%** – Relative to the parent element
- **em** – Relative to the font size of the parent
- **rem** – Relative to the root (`html`) font size
- **ch** – Based on the width of the character "0"
- **vh** – Relative to viewport height
- **vw** – Relative to viewport width

Relative units are preferred for responsive and flexible designs.
