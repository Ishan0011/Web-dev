# Pseudo-elements in CSS

Pseudo-elements are used to style specific parts of an HTML element.

They allow styling of content such as the first letter, first line, or content added before or after an element without modifying the HTML.

Pseudo-elements help enhance design and layout while keeping the markup clean.
