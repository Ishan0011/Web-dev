# Inheritance in CSS

Inheritance in CSS refers to the process where child elements receive certain styles from their parent elements.

Properties related to text and fonts are commonly inherited, while layout and box-model properties are usually not inherited.

Inheritance helps reduce repetition and maintain consistent styling across elements.
   
Examples include text color, font family, and font size.

In CSS, some properties are automatically passed from parent elements to their children, while others are not.

## Non-Inherited Properties
Non-inherited properties are not passed from parent to child elements by default.

These properties usually control layout, spacing, and visual structure.

Examples include margin, padding, border, width, and height.
