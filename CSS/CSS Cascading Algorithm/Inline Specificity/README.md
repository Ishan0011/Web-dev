# Inline Specificity in CSS

Inline specificity refers to styles applied directly within an HTML element using the `style` attribute.

Inline styles have higher priority than element, class, and ID selectors.

They should be used sparingly, as they reduce maintainability and override external styles easily.
     
### Inline > id > class > element
