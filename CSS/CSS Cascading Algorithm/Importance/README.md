# !important in CSS

The `!important` rule is used to give a CSS declaration the highest priority.

It overrides all other CSS rules, including inline styles and selector specificity.

The use of `!important` is generally discouraged, as it breaks the normal CSS cascading and makes code harder to maintain.
