# Cascade Order in CSS

Cascade order defines the sequence CSS follows to decide which style rule is applied when multiple rules affect the same element.

CSS applies styles based on the following order of priority.

## Cascade Order

1. **Importance**
2. **Specificity**
3. **Source Order**
4. **Inline Specificity**

The cascade order ensures that CSS styles are applied in a clear and predictable manner.
