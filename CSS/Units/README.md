# Units in CSS

CSS units are used to define the size of elements such as width, height, margin, padding, and font size.

CSS units are broadly divided into **Absolute** and **Relative** units.

# Absolute Units in CSS

Absolute units are fixed measurement units in CSS that do not change based on screen size or parent elements.

They provide precise control over element sizes but are not flexible for responsive design.

Common absolute units include pixels, points, picas, centimeters, millimeters, and inches.

# Relative Units in CSS

Relative units in CSS define sizes based on other elements or the viewport rather than fixed values.

They help create responsive and flexible layouts that adapt to different screen sizes.

Common relative units include percentages, em, rem, viewport-based units, and character-based units.
