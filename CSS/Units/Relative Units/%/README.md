# Percentage (%) Unit in CSS

The percentage (`%`) unit is a relative unit that defines sizes based on the parent element.

It is commonly used for width, height, margin, padding, and font size to create flexible and responsive layouts.

The actual value of a percentage depends on the size of the parent element.
