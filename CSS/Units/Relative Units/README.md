## Relative Units

Relative units adjust their size based on other elements or the viewport.

Common relative units include:
- **%** – Relative to the parent element
- **em** – Relative to the font size of the parent
- **rem** – Relative to the root element’s font size
- **ch** – Relative to the width of the character "0"
- **vh** – Relative to the viewport height
- **vw** – Relative to the viewport width

Relative units are preferred for responsive and flexible layouts.
