# rem Unit in CSS

The `rem` unit stands for **root em**.

It is a relative unit that is based on the font size of the root (`html`) element instead of the parent element.

## Advantage of rem

Using `rem` avoids the snowballing effect seen with `em`, because all values are calculated from a single root font size.

This makes layouts more predictable, consistent, and easier to maintain, especially in large projects.
