# Pixel (px) Unit in CSS

The `px` unit represents a fixed measurement in CSS.

It provides precise control over element size and does not scale relative to parent elements or the viewport.

While `px` is easy to use and predictable, it is less flexible for responsive designs compared to relative units.
