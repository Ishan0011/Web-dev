## Absolute Units

Absolute units have fixed values and do not change based on screen size or parent elements.

Common absolute units include:
- **px** – Pixels
- **pt** – Points
- **pc** – Picas
- **cm** – Centimeters
- **mm** – Millimeters
- **in** – Inches

Absolute units are generally not recommended for responsive design.
