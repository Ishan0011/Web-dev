# Background Image in CSS

The `background-image` property is used to set an image as the background of an element.

It allows images to be placed behind content without affecting the layout of the element.

- `background-image:url(imj.jpg)`

# Background Size in CSS

The `background-size` property is used to control the size of a background image.

- `background-size:` contain/cover/auto;  .

## contain
The `contain` value scales the background image so that it fits entirely within the container.

The whole image is visible, but empty space may appear if the aspect ratio does not match.

## cover
The `cover` value scales the background image to completely cover the container.

The image fills the entire container, but some parts of the image may be cropped.

## auto
The `auto` value displays the background image at its original size.

The image is not scaled unless other size values are specified.
