# Class Selector in CSS

The class selector is used to select one or more HTML elements that share the same class name.

It is identified using the `.` (dot) symbol and can be applied to multiple elements on a webpage.

Class selectors are commonly used for styling groups of elements and reusable components.


.class-name* {   
 p : v;   
}
