# Descendant Selector in CSS

The descendant selector is used to select elements that are nested inside another element.

It targets child, grandchild, or any deeper elements within a specified parent.

This selector is commonly used to apply styles based on the structure of the HTML document.


eg:- div p a{   
    p:v;   
}  
selecting anchor tag inside paragraph in div. 
#### there could be multiple 'div p a' so defining a class is better option
 div class = abc    
 ".abc p a"
