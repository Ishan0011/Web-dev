# ID Selector in CSS

The ID selector is used to select a **single unique HTML element**.

It is identified using the `#` symbol and should be used only once within a webpage.

ID selectors have higher specificity than element and class selectors and are commonly used for unique elements.
   
#myID* {    
  property: value;   
}
