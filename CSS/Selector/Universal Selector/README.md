# Universal Selector in CSS

The universal selector (`*`) is used to select **all elements** on a webpage.

It applies the same styles to every HTML element and is commonly used for setting default styles such as margin, padding, and box sizing.

The universal selector should be used carefully, as it affects the entire document.
   
 *{   
    property: value;  
 }
