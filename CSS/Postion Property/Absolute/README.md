# Absolute Position in CSS

The `absolute` value removes an element from the normal document flow.

The element is positioned relative to the nearest ancestor that has a position other than static.

If no such ancestor exists, it is positioned relative to the document body.

Absolute positioning is used for precise placement of elements.

There is no space created for an absolute value.
