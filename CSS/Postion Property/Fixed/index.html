            <p>Seasons of India

India is a country with different seasons. Each season has its own weather, <br>colours, smells, sounds and living creatures. <br>
 The five main seasons of India are Summer, Rainy, Autumn, Pre-Winter and Winter. <br>These seasons bring changes in nature <br> and
  affect plants, animals and human life. <br>

Summer is the hottest season of the year. During summer,<br> the environment looks light green, yellow and brown because many leaves <br>
dry up. The sky is bright blue and clear. Fruits <br>like mango and watermelon are seen in yellow and red colours. <br>
 The air smells dry and hot. Leaves, bark and stems feel<br> dry and rough. Animals and birds rest in shade to protect <br>
  themselves from heat. We hear sounds of birds, insects and hot winds in nature. <br>

The Rainy season brings rainfall and <br>freshness. Trees and plants become dark green and healthy. <br> The sky looks grey or dark blue 
with <br>
 clouds. The smell of wet soil fills the <br>air and feels pleasant. Leaves and soil feel wet and soft. <br> Frogs, peacocks and <br>
 insects are <br>
   commonly seen during this season. The sound of raindrops, <br>
    thunder and croaking frogs can be heard everywhere. <br>

Autumn is a season when leaves begin to fall. The environment shows yellow, brown and light green colours. <br> The sky is clear <br>
and blue. <br>
 Fruits and seeds appear yellow and dry. The weather is mild and pleasant. <br> Leaves feel dry and light. <br>
  Birds and small animals like squirrels are active. <br>
   The sound of dry leaves falling and birds chirping can be heard. <br>

Pre-Winter is the season before winter begins. The weather becomes cool and dry. <br>
 Plants remain green, and grains and vegetables grow well. The sky looks pale blue. <br> The air smells fresh and cool. <br>
  Leaves and stems feel cool to touch. Birds start migrating, and gentle wind sounds are heard. <br>

Winter is the coldest season. The environment appears dark green and brown. The sky is pale blue or grey. <br>
 Green vegetables and dry fruits are common in this season. The air smells cold and fresh. <br>
  Leaves and bark feel cold and hard. Animals try to stay warm, and insects are fewer. Cold winds and soft <br> bird sounds are  <br> 
  heard in nature.<br>

In conclusion, each season of India is unique and beautiful.<br> Seasons help plants grow, animals survive and make <br>nature balanced.
<br> They also teach us how <br> nature changes throughout the year.</p>
