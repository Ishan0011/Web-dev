# Border Radius in CSS

The `border-radius` property is used to round the corners of an element.

It softens sharp edges and helps create modern and visually appealing designs.

Border radius can be applied to all corners or individually to specific corners of an element.

div{   
    border-radius: 15px;  
}    
   
div{  
    border-radius: 50%;    
}
