The `border` property is used to create a visible boundary around an element/content area.

It surrounds the padding and content and helps define the shape and separation of elements.

  Defines the thickness of the border.

- **border-style**  
  Specifies the style of the border such as solid, dashed, or dotted.

- **border-color**  
  Sets the color of the border.
