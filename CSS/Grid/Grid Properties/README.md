# Common Alignment Properties in CSS

CSS provides common alignment properties that work in both Flexbox and Grid layouts.

These properties control how items are aligned horizontally and vertically.

---

## Horizontal Alignment

- **justify-items** (container)  
  Aligns all items horizontally inside their grid or flex container.

- **justify-self** (item)  
  Aligns an individual item horizontally within its container.

---

## Vertical Alignment

- **align-items** (container)  
  Aligns all items vertically inside the container.

- **align-self** (item)  
  Aligns an individual item vertically within its container.

---

## Combined Alignment

- **place-items**  
  Shorthand for `align-items` and `justify-items`.

- **place-self**  
  Shorthand for `align-self` and `justify-self`.

These properties help create clean, centered, and responsive layouts.
