# Grid Model in CSS

The CSS Grid Model is a two-dimensional layout system that organizes content into rows and columns.

It provides precise control over layout structure using grid lines, grid tracks, and grid cells.

## Grid Lines

Grid lines are the horizontal and vertical lines that divide the grid.

- Horizontal lines are called **row lines**
- Vertical lines are called **column lines**

Grid lines are numbered and are used to position grid items.

## Grid Track

A grid track is the space between two adjacent grid lines.

It represents a single row or a single column in the grid.

## Grid Cell

A grid cell is the smallest unit of a grid.

It is formed by the intersection of a row track and a column track.
