# Percentage (%) in CSS Animations

In CSS animations, percentages are used inside `@keyframes` to define animation stages.

They represent the progress of the animation timeline.

## Percentage Keyframes

- **0%**  
  Represents the starting point of the animation.

- **50%**  
  Represents the middle state of the animation.

- **100%**  
  Represents the final state of the animation.

Using percentages allows precise control over how styles change at different points during the animation.

They provide more flexibility than using only `from` and `to`.
