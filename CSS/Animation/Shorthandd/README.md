# CSS Animations

CSS Animations are used to animate HTML elements without using JavaScript.

They allow smooth transitions between different states of an element.

---

## @keyframes

The `@keyframes` rule is used to define an animation sequence.

It acts as a template that describes how an element should change over time.

---

## from and to

- **from**  
  Represents the initial state of the animation.

- **to**  
  Represents the final state of the animation.

---

The animation gradually changes the element’s properties from the initial state to the final state.
