# Flex Sizing in CSS

Flex sizing controls how flex items grow, shrink, and take up space inside a flex container.

It allows flexible distribution of available space based on defined rules rather than fixed sizes.

Flex sizing is managed using properties like `flex-grow`, `flex-shrink`, and `flex-basis`.
