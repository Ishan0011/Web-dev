# Flex Shorthand in CSS

The `flex` shorthand property is used to define flex-grow, flex-shrink, and flex-basis in a single declaration.

It simplifies flex sizing and makes the code more readable and manageable.

The order of values :-

- **flex-grow | flex-shrink | flex-basis** `flex: 2 2 100px;`

- **flex-grow | flex-basis** `flex: 2 100px;`

- **flex-grow/flex-shrink** `flex-(grow/shrink): 2;`  

- **flex-basis** `flex: 100px`
