# flex-wrap in CSS

The `flex-wrap` property controls whether flex items are forced to stay on a single line or can wrap onto multiple lines.

It helps manage overflow when flex items exceed the size of the flex container.

  All flex items stay on a single line, even if they overflow the container.

- **wrap** `flex-wrap: wrap;`  
  Flex items wrap onto multiple lines when there is not enough space.
