# Media Queries in CSS

Media Queries are used to create **responsive websites** by applying CSS styles based on the device or environment.

They allow websites to adapt to different screen sizes and orientations.

## Media Features

Media queries work using **media features**, most commonly:

- **width** – viewport width
- **height** – viewport height
- **orientation** – portrait or landscape

These features describe the device or screen environment.

---

## Viewport Width

The `width` media feature refers to the **viewport width**, not the device width.

CSS rules inside a media query are applied only when the condition is true.

## Why Use Media Queries?

- Make layouts responsive

- Control styles for different screen sizes
