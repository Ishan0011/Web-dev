# Child Combinator in CSS

The child combinator is used to select elements that are **direct children** of a specified parent element.

It targets only the immediate child elements and does not affect deeper nested elements "As decendent selector ".

The child combinator helps apply styles with precise control over HTML structure.

Eg - Selects all buttons which are direct children of spans   

span > button {   
property: value;  
}
