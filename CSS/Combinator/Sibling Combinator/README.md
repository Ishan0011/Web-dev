# Sibling Combinator in CSS

The sibling combinator is used to select elements that share the same parent element.

It targets elements that appear at the same level in the HTML structure and come after another element.

CSS provides adjacent sibling and general sibling combinators for this purpose.   
   
#### Eg- h3 that come immediately after any p   
p + h3{   
    p:v;   
}
