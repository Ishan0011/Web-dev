# Pseudo-class in CSS

A pseudo-class is used to define a special state of an HTML element.

It allows styles to be applied when an element is in a specific condition, such as when it is hovered, focused, or active.

Pseudo-classes help create interactive and dynamic user experiences without JavaScript.
